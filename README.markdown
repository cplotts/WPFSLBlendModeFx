<h1>WPF 4.0 Blend Mode Effect Library</h1>

<p>This is a library of blend modes that can be used with WPF 4.0 (and forward).</p>

<p>I recently went through (for fun) and compiled all the HLSL effect (.fx) files into pixel shader (.ps) files. This means that the library is now really a standalone library that you can just easily use in your WPF projects. I don't know why I haven't done this before!</p>

<p>I have a <a href="https://www.cplotts.com/category/pixel-shader-effects/">series of blog posts</a> that describe these blend mode effects ... and which also details the journey in creating the library itself.</p>

<p>If you happen to use my library, I would love to hear about it. It was a fun labor of love!</p>
